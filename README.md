# testimonials-grid-section-main
A challenge downloaded from https://www.frontendmentor.io/
I chose this challenge because I wanted to use Grid in a project, since I just learned how to use it through Free Code Camp, but had no practical experience.
My idea was that the layout generated through Grid would adapt itself going through smaller and smaller resolutions, oh how naive. I realized it would not work like this, so I had to write a media query in order to have a suitable version of the page for smaller screens. It allowed me to play with a new function I learned a few days ago calc(), and vh and vw, that I had never used before.
In conclusion, the project might not be mobile first, but it allowed me to face issues I had not anticipated, and to overcome them using new techs, I think this is what matters for a first commit.
